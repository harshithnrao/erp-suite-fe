# ERP Suite Frontend (Angular)

Welcome to the frontend of **ERP Suite**, an enterprise-grade web application built using **Angular**. This suite integrates multiple business-critical modules — **HRMS**, **Finance**, **CRM**, and **SCM** — into one cohesive platform.

## 📦 Modules

The ERP Suite is divided into key business domains:

- **HRMS (Human Resource Management System)**: Manage employees, attendance, payroll, departments, leaves, and documents.
- **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**: Track leads, follow-ups, proposals, contracts, logs, and feedback.
- **Finance**: Handle accounts payable/receivable, invoicing, budgets, audits, general ledger, transactions, and more.
- **SCM (Supply Chain Management)**: Module directory included and extensible.
- **Dashboard**: High-level summary widgets to get insights at a glance.
